## How It Works

Maestro generates flashcards using AI-generated sentences based on the user's vocabulary and proficiency. The platform uses OpenAI's ChatGPT to create contextually appropriate sentences using the user's known words. Each flashcard includes a sentence, its translation, and an optional image.

Learners review flashcards and provide answers to the words they are asked to recall. Maestro then employs an SRS algorithm to calculate the next review date for each sentence based on their performance. The SRS algorithm adjusts the review intervals to optimize long-term retention and ensure effective learning.

## The Science Behind Maestro

The Spaced Repetition System (SRS) is a widely recognized learning technique that emphasizes reviewing material at increasing intervals to improve long-term retention. It is based on the idea that learners can effectively remember information if it is reviewed just before it is about to be forgotten. Maestro leverages the power of SRS to create an efficient and effective learning experience tailored to each user's progress.

OpenAI's ChatGPT, a powerful natural language processing AI, plays a crucial role in generating contextually appropriate sentences using the user's known words. This ensures that learners encounter a diverse array of sentences, improving their understanding of the language and its intricacies.

By combining the principles of SRS with the capabilities of ChatGPT, Maestro offers a unique and personalized language learning experience that adapts to each learner's needs and preferences.
